Subject: RE: Unity Catalog Service credential is in preview

Hi [Team/All],

Thank you, D, for validating the NCC setup configuration.

I am now able to test the NCC setup for serverless compute.
Here’s a summary of the completed setup:
	1.	NCC was created at the Databricks account level using Terraform.
	2.	Private connections were successfully established to serverless compute nodes from both Key Vault and Azure OpenAI.
	3.	After these configurations, the Key Vault service credentials were successfully tested from the serverless compute environment.

Notes:
	•	Private endpoints were created as follows:
	•	Key Vault: Within the respective subnet, including a private endpoint for Databricks NCC.
	•	OpenAI: Similarly within the subnet, along with a private endpoint for Databricks NCC.
	•	An additional package (typing_extensions==4.5.0) was installed on the serverless compute node during the testing of the service credentials.

Please let me know if further clarification or additional steps are needed.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Let me know if you’d like to adjust anything further!
